    "We can have the sequences of patients in reality. We can cluster the patients by using the information given by their sequences. The ground truths are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. According to the sequence, we can know whether a patient is resistant or not based on the resistant mutations given by the resi.vcf file. It means that resistant and unresistant patients will not be in a same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In our ground clusters, every cluster is the set of nodes in a transmission tree. It means that the sequence distances between the nodes in the same cluster are relatively small. Given a sequence, we can find the most alike sequences based on distance profile and put them into a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the result of simulation, we can easily put all the unremoved patients into resistant and unresistant patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For resistant patients, a distance profile is calculated. When a pair of 2 patients have resistance related SNPs, the distance between them is the hamming distance between the two sequences. Otherwise, their distance is infinitely great. Given a distance threshold, patients can be put into clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For unresistant patients, given a distance threshold, patients can be put into clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments\n",
    "---------\n",
    "I tried several time based on 12-generation simulation, given a appropriate distance threshold, the precision, recall and F1 based on the ground truth could be around 1. Small distance threshold led to low recall, and big distance threshold led to low precision."
