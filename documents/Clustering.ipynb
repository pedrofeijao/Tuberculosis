    "We can have the sequences of patients in reality. We can cluster the patients by using the information given by their sequences. The ground truths are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. According to the sequence, we can know whether a patient is resistant or not based on the resistant mutations given by the resi.vcf file. It means that resistant and unresistant patients will not be in a same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In our ground clusters, every cluster is the set of nodes in a transmission tree. It means that the sequence distances between the nodes in the same cluster are relatively small. Given a sequence, we can find the most alike sequences based on distance profile and put them into a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the result of simulation, we can easily put all the unremoved patients into resistant and unresistant patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For resistant patients, a distance profile is calculated. When a pair of 2 patients have resistance related SNPs, the distance between them is the hamming distance between the two sequences. Otherwise, their distance is infinitely great. Given a distance threshold, patients can be put into clusters. \n",
